# ML_Projects

This is a repository that showcases multiple Machine Learning projects I have completed. They include clustering, neural networks, etc.

### Clustering Project
The clustering project uses data on NBA players' stats from there individual seasons dating back to the 1980s. I used both simple basketball stats and all stats including advance statistics as the features. The amount and type of features did not change the output of the types of clusters that were forming. A more in depth analysis is written at the end of the python file describing the summary of what the algorithm decided the cluster the players into. In short, the players were clustered in the type of role they had on the team, not necessarily just position wise like all-around contributor (Lebron James, Larry Bird, Nikola Jokic) all-nba type of season, a role player season that contributed in the rotation but was not the main focus on offense, or a big man sort of role that encompasses strictly playing in the low post and not any outside presense on the offense (for example, Shaq or Rudy Gobert).
